Master Project at New England Institute of Technology September 2018 – December 2018
Title: Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for the Power Consumption Prediction
In this innovative project, I conducted a comparative analysis of various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision tree, random forest, feedforward neural network, and support vector machine for regression.
The aim was to predict the power consumption of three distribution networks in Tetouan City. The dataset that I utilized in this work is exclusive and has not been used before and is used to predict the power consumption of 10 minutes, and one-hour periods.
Calendar and weather predictive variables were included, and it was shown that hour and temperature were the most predictive prominent variable. I optimized the comparative models by grid search to figure out the best parameters of the models.
The results indicate that the random forest model outperformed other models for the prediction of electricity power consumption of Tetouan City. This work can be applied efficiently for Morocco’s different power suppliers and distribution companies.
